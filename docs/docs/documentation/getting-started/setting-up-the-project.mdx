# Setting Up the Project

Setting up your project with Zelthy is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your project's root folder, initialize the project, and configure the necessary settings:

#### 1. Choose a Directory:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project's root folder. You can use your preferred file explorer or the command line to create and navigate to this directory.

#### 2. Install Zelthy and Start a New Project:

After installing Zelthy, you can use the `zelthy3 start-project` command to initiate the creation of a new project. Replace `"MyFirstProject"` with your preferred project name.

```bash
zelthy3 start-project "MyFirstProject"
```

#### 3. Provide Database Credentials:

During the project setup, you'll be prompted to provide your PostgreSQL database credentials. These credentials include:

- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Database Password**
- **Database Host**
- **Database Port** (default is usually 5432)

If the provided credentials are incorrect or if there are issues with the database connection, the setup process will throw errors and cancel the project creation. This is because Zelthy will create schemas and perform migrations during the project's creation.

#### 4. Migrate Schemas and Create Public Tenant:

Upon successful database connection, the setup process will automatically migrate schemas and create a public tenant. This ensures that your project is ready to go with the necessary database structure.

#### 5. Configure Default Platform User:

Next, you'll be asked to provide details for the default platform user. This user serves as the first administrator and will have access to z-Dynamic, where you can begin creating apps. You'll need to provide the following information:

- **Platform User Email Address**
- **Password**
- **Password Confirmation**

Once you've entered these details, the setup process will create the default platform user for your project.

#### 6. Project Folder Structure and Boilerplate Code:

With all the necessary configurations in place, the setup process will proceed to create your project's folder structure and populate it with boilerplate code. You're now ready to start developing your healthcare apps within the Zelthy platform.
