# DDM Field Types

Dynamic Data Models (DDMs) in Zelthy support various field types, allowing you to define flexible and customized data structures for each tenant within your multi-tenant application. These field types can be broadly categorized into two groups: non-relational fields and relational fields.

## Non-Relational Fields

Non-relational fields in DDMs are equivalent to Django's standard field types and can be imported directly from Django. These fields are suitable for representing simple data types like text, numbers, dates, and more. Here are some common non-relational field types:

1. **CharField**: Used for short text strings like names, titles, or labels.
   
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
   ```

2. **IntegerField**: Ideal for storing whole numbers.
   
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       age = models.IntegerField()
   ```

3. **DateField**: Designed to hold date values.
   
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       birthdate = models.DateField()
   ```

4. **BooleanField**: Represents true/false values.
   
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
   ```

These non-relational fields behave just like their Django counterparts, making them suitable for straightforward data storage within your DDMs.

## Relational Fields

Relational fields in DDMs are specialized field types imported from Zelthy's `zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields`. They allow you to establish relationships between Dynamic Data Models, offering more flexibility in your data modeling approach. Here are some common relational field types:

1. **OneToOneField**: Defines a one-to-one relationship between two DDMs.

   ```python
   from zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields import OneToOneField

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       related_model = OneToOneField('AnotherDynamicModel')
   ```

2. **ForeignKey**: Establishes a many-to-one relationship between two DDMs.

   ```python
   from zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields import ForeignKey

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       related_models = ForeignKey('AnotherDynamicModel')
   ```

3. **ManyToManyField**: Sets up a many-to-many relationship between two DDMs.

   ```python
   from zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields import ManyToManyField

   class MyDDM(DynamicModelBase):
       related_models = ManyToManyField('AnotherDynamicModel')
   ```

These relational fields enable you to create complex data relationships and structures tailored to the unique needs of your tenants or clients.

In summary, Zelthy's DDM field types provide a versatile and powerful toolset for creating dynamic and customized data structures in multi-tenant applications. Whether you need simple text fields or intricate data relationships, DDMs offer the flexibility to meet your diverse data modeling requirements.
