# Running the Development Server

Now that you've set up your project using Zelthy, the next step is to start the development server. This server allows you to access z-Dynamic, where you can begin creating your healthcare apps. Follow these steps to run the development server:

#### 1. Navigate to Your Project Folder:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you created your project's root folder. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command to move to the project directory. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project folder.

#### 2. Start the Development Server:

Once you're inside the project folder, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This command will initiate the development server, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Running the development server is a crucial step in your project setup, as it provides you with a local environment for app development and testing.
