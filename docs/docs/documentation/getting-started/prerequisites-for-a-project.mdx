# Prerequisites for Setting Up the Project

Before you embark on setting up your project with Zelthy, there are certain prerequisites that need to be met. One of the crucial prerequisites is the setup of a PostgreSQL database. Here's a brief guide on what needs to be done:

## PostgreSQL Database Setup

To get started, follow these steps to set up a PostgreSQL database:

#### 1. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   - If you haven't already, you'll need to install PostgreSQL on your system. You can download the PostgreSQL installer for your platform from the official website: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

#### 2. **Create a Fresh Database:**
   - Once PostgreSQL is installed, open your terminal or a PostgreSQL client.
   - Use the following command to create a new database. Replace `your_database_name` with the desired name for your project's database:
     ```
     createdb your_database_name
     ```
   - Ensure that the newly created database is fresh without any existing tables or data.

With the PostgreSQL database set up and ready to go, you can proceed with setting up your Zelthy project, confident that you have the necessary infrastructure in place.

Keep in mind that the exact steps for installing PostgreSQL may vary depending on your operating system. Be sure to consult the PostgreSQL documentation or installation guide for your specific platform if you encounter any issues during the installation process.
