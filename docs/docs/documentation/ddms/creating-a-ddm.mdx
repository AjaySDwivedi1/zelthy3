# Creating a DDM

Dynamic Data Models (DDMs) in Zelthy are a powerful way to define custom data structures tailored to the unique needs of individual tenants in a multi-tenant application. Defining a DDM class in Zelthy is quite similar to creating a model class in Django, with a few distinctions.

Here, we'll walk you through the process of creating a Dynamic Data Model in Zelthy:

## Step 1: File Location

DDMs are defined inside the module folder of your Zelthy application, in a file named `models.py`. This file serves as the blueprint for your data models within a specific module.

## Step 2: Extending DynamicModelBase

In Zelthy, DDM classes need to extend `DynamicModelBase`, a base class provided by Zelthy's framework. This extension is essential to make your model dynamic and tenant-specific. Here's an example of defining a DDM class:

```python
from zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.models import DynamicModelBase

class CustomModel(DynamicModelBase):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    # Add more fields as needed
```

The non-relational fields, such as `CharField` and `TextField`, are defined just like they are in Django.

## Step 3: Relational Fields

For relational fields, such as ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField, you'll need to import them from `zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields` instead of Django's `models`. Here's an example:

```python
from zelthy.apps.dynamic_models.fields import OneToOneField

class CustomModel(DynamicModelBase):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    related_model = OneToOneField('AnotherDynamicModel')
    # Add more fields as needed
```

Note that you reference another DDM using a string with its name within single quotes (' '). This allows Zelthy to handle dynamic model relationships properly.

## Step 4: Define Your Fields

Customize your DDM class by adding fields that match your tenant's specific data requirements. You can include various field types provided by Django and Zelthy to represent different data types, including text, numbers, dates, and more.

With these steps, you've successfully created a Dynamic Data Model in Zelthy, allowing you to have unique data structures for each tenant within your multi-tenant application. This flexibility empowers you to meet the diverse needs of your clients or organizations while maintaining data isolation and security.
